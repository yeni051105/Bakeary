# Project Name: 
Bakeary
# Application Description
- BakeBloom is a fun and supportive baking web app that combines dessert quiz recommendations with a personal baking log.
- Users can take a short quiz to get dessert suggestions based on their preferences and kitchen setup. After baking, they can log their creations, upload pictures, and reflect on their experience. BakeBloom also rewards users with cute badges for trying different categories of desserts!
- This project is ideal for beginner to intermediate bakers who want both inspiration and a way to track their baking journey.
# Features
- Dessert Recommendation Quiz：A short interactive quiz that suggests desserts based on mood, flavor preference, and available tools (uses JavaScript and possibly a recipe API like Spoonacular).
- Baking Diary：Users can log their bakes with photos, notes, and ratings. Each entry is saved locally or to GitHub Pages for persistence (React + localStorage or GitHub data).
- Achievement Badge System：Unlock badges based on the types of desserts completed (e.g., cake, bread, cookies). Adds a gamified and rewarding feel.
- Wishlist Feature：Users can save “To-Bake” desserts for future inspiration.
